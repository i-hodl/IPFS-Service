# 🚀✨ Magical IPFS Uploader for macOS

Unleash the magic of decentralized file sharing with this little tool! Right-click, upload, and sprinkle some stardust on your IPFS workflow. From sharing files to hosting cosmic websites, this script makes it all as easy as a wave of a wizard's wand!

## 🧙‍♂️ Introduction

This enchanted script allows you to upload files and folders to IPFS directly from your macOS Finder. Pin the content, copy the IPFS hash to your clipboard, and embark on a decentralized adventure!

## 📜 Requirements
- macOS, the land of your digital realm
- IPFS, the gateway to the decentralized universe

## ⚙️ Configuration

Find the IP address and port of your IPFS API. If you're the local wizard, use `127.0.0.1` and `5001`. If IPFS resides on a mystical device, discover its IP on your network.

## 🎩 Usage

1. **Craft the Spell (Create the Script):**
   - Conjure the script into a `.sh` file, like `ipfs_upload.sh`.
2. **Whisper to the IPFS Spirits (Set API Address and Port):**
   - Inscribe `YOUR_IPFS_API_ADDRESS` and `YOUR_IPFS_API_PORT` with the correct runes.
3. **Empower the Scroll (Make the Script Executable):**
   - Invoke `chmod +x /path/to/ipfs_upload.sh` in your Terminal.
4. **Summon an Automator Familiar:**
   - Create a new service in Automator.
   - Command it to receive "files or folders" in "Finder."
   - Add a "Run Shell Script" action with "/bin/bash," and paste the spell.
   - Bind the service.
5. **Cast the Upload Spell:**
   - Right-click a folder or file.
   - Select "Services" and choose your service.
   - The IPFS hash is now in your clipboard, ready for the IPFS Desktop or Web UI.

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

Should you face the unknown, consult the ancient scrolls (`ipfs_log.csv`) in your home directory.
